I think you can use a negative lookahead here, combined with character classes.

/(?![\x{000d}\x{000a}\x{0009}])\p{C}/u
What this does is use a negative lookahead to assert that the character is not one of those specified in the character class. Then it traverses the character again to match it with any control character.

I used the perl syntax for specifying single unicode points.
