I think it completely depends on your target audience. The main reason that standards are in place is to allow web developers to target everyone, regardless of their browser/operating device. Yes, most people using a computer or modern phone are going to be able to run JavaScript. So you can not worry about non-js browsers and get away with it.

But, at least in the USA, there is a focus on accessibility for people with disabilities. Screen readers for the blind, computer data entry for those who type with something other than a keyboard, and other ways of browsing for the disabled means that web developers need to be aware of non-traditional users. There are some good guidelines on the ADA's website that explain what to watch out for.

So it all depends on how accessible you want your website to be and how much you care about including everyone regardless of their mode of browsing.
